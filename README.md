# World Wide Medical Staff Data

Description of medical staffing world wide by country and year from the World Health Organization.

This project ended up being a lot of EDA without predictions. One of the challenges with this data set was missing values, lots of them.  THere are so many missing values from developed countries that it is hard to do a proper analysis.  For example the United States has provided no data on the amount of General Medical Practitioners or Specialty Practioners.  We know this is false and that the United States has lots of Specialty doctors.  Missing values like this skews the data severely.  There are also lots of missing years in the data.  It is really hard to do a proper analysis with the data that is given.
